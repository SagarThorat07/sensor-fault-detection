# sensor-fault-detection
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to accurately predict failures in the APS (Air Pressure System) and reduce the cost of unnecessary repairs. By using historical data and advanced algorithms, it is possible to build a model that can identify patterns and correlations in the data and accurately predict failures in the APS system.
